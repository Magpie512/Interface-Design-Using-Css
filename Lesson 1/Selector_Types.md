## CSS Selector Types
### Simple Selectors
---
##### Element Selector 
Based on the element name (ie. p for < p >)
##### Id Selector 
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

##### Class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

(ie .error OR label.error)

##### Universal Selector ( * )
Selects all HTML elements on the page

##### Grouped Selectors (h1, h2, p)
Selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

##### Contextual
Any h1 element contained within a < section > element.
(ie. section h1)
