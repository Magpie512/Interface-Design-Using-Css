# The CSS Rockstar

## Description

Construct a web page featuring the lyrics of a song that is meaningful to you, using thoughtful typography and layout applied with CSS. Include one or two paragraphs about the song and a short section about the artist or band. Style the page in a way that reflects the visual spirit of the album cover associated with the song.

Your page must use appropriate page‑level sectioning elements and semantically meaningful HTML to structure the content. Choose two typefaces inspired by the album’s typography—one for headings and one for body text. Use a variety of CSS selectors, text‑sizing techniques, and typographic styles to create an attractive, readable layout.

All HTML and CSS must be hand‑built. AI‑generated code is not permitted. Cite any resources used in your code comments.
