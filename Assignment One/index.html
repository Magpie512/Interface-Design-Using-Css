        <h2>Pop Culture Presence</h2>

        <p> In the AMC Series Pantheon, aired in 2022, Pearl Jam's music was featured prominently.</p>

        <p> The song "Alive" was used in several episodes, highlighting key emotional moments for the characters. The
          show's creators chose Pearl Jam's music to underscore themes of identity and transformation, resonating with
          the series' exploration of human consciousness and technology.</p>

        <h2>Personal Relation</h2>

        <p><small>I don't relate to how the song is written but by how I perceived it when I first really listened to it.</small></p>

        <p>When Pantheon came out, I was lost in a dark place, both mentally and physically. By the time the fall of
          2024 had rolled around I had already saved myself physically and I don't know what did it but I finally was
          able to "wake up" out of my depression.
          <br />
          Now, I am playing catch up on a life I never thought I could have. Just like David Kim, I want people to know
          I exist. Even if it is just a classroom on a Wednesday, even if it is just the kindergarteners, or even if it
          is just me. I want to know I am Alive.</p>
        
          <p>I promise if you watch the show it'll make alot more sense.</p>
