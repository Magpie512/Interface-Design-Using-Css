DESCRIPTION

On your own, attempt to reconstruct as faithfully as possible one of the provided magazine layouts (your choice) using the provided HTML document, your own CSS and one or more images. All CSS must be original work. You may not use a 3rd-party CSS framework or theme components, nor can you generate any CSS using generative AI.



INSTRUCTIONS

Select one of the scanned magazine articles provided.
Create a local and remote Git repository.
Examine the appropriate HTML file.
Set the base language for the page, apply an appropriate character encoding, normalize the CSS, and add a viewport meta tag to control basic rendering on a mobile device. Do not modify the HTML file - the focus of the assignment should be your CSS.
Using an external CSS file, attempt to faithfully reproduce a web-appropriate version of the layout (you may use other images as substitutes for the ones in the articles provided for better resolution if you wish).
Do the best you can in trying to make your layout resemble the magazine layout. Respect that Web is not print design, it is the Web.
Ensure that the HTML is valid (http://validator.w3.org/).
Be sure that your CSS is also valid (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
Regularly stage and commit your code changes with short but descriptive comments in your code repository.


TAKE IT FURTHER

Attempt to get your page (including all HTML, CSS and images) under 100KB in total.
Try building your layout such that it can accommodate different browser window widths (responsive or adaptive) using CSS media queries.
Take a few liberties with the page and add web-appropriate user-interface elements (like navigation or social links) where appropriate.
Anything else that you can dream up…


SUBMITTING YOUR WORK

Upload the HTML, CSS and any media files to your account on the server and then post a URL to the document in the project on Blackboard. Please also provide a link to your Github repository that documents the process of developing the CSS layout via regular commit comments.
